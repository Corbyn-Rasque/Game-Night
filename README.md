# CSC 365 Team Project: Game Night

## Concept

Game Night would be a project to find current and upcoming game night planned at Cal Poly dorms/apartments, where what the console/game combo or board game, open player seats, and time/duration/location would be listed. Brackets could be done within each party or between parties. Equipment & Food/Supplies lists could be used to coordinate what needs to be brought along (controllers, game discs, TVs, pizza, etc). Plans could be posted in advanced, so people would know what to expect potential noise above or below apartments. Bracket data could be used to determine which players might be a close match for future matches and might inform future brackets, as well.
