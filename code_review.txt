Code Review Comments - Ivana Thomas #13

• When canceling an event, the event still shows up in @GET/events/{event_id} and looks the same as an active event. 
If a boolean is going to be used to handle cancellation, it would be good to return that to the user as well.
- We want to keep the previous events on this table for lookups. However, it is important to know the 
status of an event, so we will provide that information. 

• There could be more error handling: try/except or adding print statements to your render log

• In items/contributions, for a reset from the user/event maybe remove the row instead of using a Boolean? Or, could 
insert a negative quantity to simplify any aggregation that might be needed at some point?

• For /events upon event creation, a more detailed response (so we know that the response is the event id).
- Correct. Also, realized we weren't following the API Spec. 

• In @POST/brackets, the API Spec doesn’t match the request body in the deployed url. Event_id is clear, but game_id 
is a little bit confusing*.
-> Game_id is more clear after seeing the next step in example flow 1. It could be improved by implementing the game 
insertion before creating the event and brackets/ making this a requirement.

• Despite use of ‘ON CONFLICT’, I was able to insert the exact same Fortnite entry into 'games', with the same platform, 
publisher, release year, and player count 4 times and got 4 separate ids.
- Fixed. Forced uniqueness on game_name and platform

• Searching by Username only in /events results in a 500 internal server error.

• Creating a bracket for an event_id that doesn’t exist in @POST/brackets results in a 500 internal error -> perhaps some 
more checking could be of use here, or make another item mandatory?

• @GET/users/{user_id} is returning {}. Per API spec, it appears it should return username and id. Returning name as an 
additional measure might be nice too!

• Super minor: datetime is imported into games, but not used
